Excuse me.

Can you remove this?

It's stuck to my lips.

Can you remove my cigarette?

It's stuck.
  
What are you, English?

You can put it out now.

You're here a lot, aren't you?

You never talk to anyone.

I've been wondering why you're always alone.

I don't really know anybody.

You're awfully clean.

What?

My mother's English.

Hi.

I've seen you around.

I'm starving.

I forgot the sandwiches.

I didn't want that night

ever to end.

Merci.

Didn't you bring anything?

No. I'm okay.

Please eat.

Don't mind me.

No. I'm really not hungry.

I've broken it now. Take it.

You're very kind, but I don't...

For goodness sake, take it when you're offered it.

This is fine.

Okay.

You're very kind.

So where are you from exactly?


And you know what my very first words were?

No. What?

"New York Herald Tribune.!"

Will you come to Rome with me?

Good night.

Hello.

Who is this?

Don't be suspicious. It's me.

Don't tell me I woke you up.

 I've been up for ages.

You don't sound as if.

I always sound like this in the morning.

Listen, you want to have dinner tomorrow night?

Um, you mean like a real dinner in a nice restaurant?

No, not in a restaurant, here at home.

Sure, that'd be great.

Yes? Okay.

Yes, yes. Why don't you meet us for a drink first

You know where it is?

Hey!

You know, there's room in here for all of us.

It's beautiful.

You think so?

Good luck.

Evening, Maman.

What are you doing here?

We're here for dinner.

What?

Hi.

Very pleased to meet you.

Likewise.

Oh, you're American, are you?

Oh.

What's wrong?


Have you got mashed potatoes for brains or what?

You're crazy!

Bitch, cow, slut...

Oh, for God's sake!

Put a sock in it!

I must apologize

No. I'm the one who should be apologizing.

That's very sweet of you.

Let me look at you.

Okay. I want you to make a good impression on Papa.

Papa, it's me.     

inspiration is like a baby.

I imagine you were listening.

We got a long day ahead of us tomorrow.

Yes, sorry. You were saying?

We should go to bed.

Are you staying?

Are you okay?

Good night.

See you in the morning.

See you.

Thank you.

Good morning.

What was that all about?                 

I was removing the sleep from your eyes.

Didn't you enjoy it?

Naturally.

What are you waiting for?

I'm not dressed.

What are you doing?

Oh, sorry. You want to use my toothbrush?

Sure?

I'll use my finger.

Sleep well?

Yeah.

Good.

You really do have the most beautiful pair of lips.

Can I touch them?

You... You wanna touch my lips?

Okay.

So red... and ripe and luscious.

So sullen, brutal.

Let's see what you look like with lipstick.

You'd make such a pretty girl.

She sucks in all the air around her.
    
You Americans understand fuck-all about your own culture.

Don't even get me started!

There's something  I have been meaning to do for a long time...

I've been waiting for the right person to do it with.

And I think you're finally it!

Well, don't worry, little man, we're not going to get caught.

This is a test, Are you going to pass it or fail it?

Be careful. A lot depends on how you answer.

It'll be cold in your room, come into mine.

I'm going to get a Coke.

My hands are full.

I was dressing.

God.! You're pathetic.

Fuck you.

Give up?

I knew that.           

I dare you to do now...

in front of us...

what I've watched you do...in front of her.

Oh, yes, you do, my pet.

What a bitch you are.

A bitch and a sadist.

Are you going to pay the forfeit or not?

Very well.

I want you to do it the way you did it... when you thought no one was watching.

Let's have a drink.

I'll meet you downstairs.

Why don't you admit you were thrilled?

Come on.

You can tell me.

What?

Weren't you just a tiny bit excited?

What is it exactly you're trying to get me to say?

I asked you a question.


Well, I suppose you know who you sound like.

You're a strange one.

I don't understand you.

Don't you have any brothers or sisters?

I masturbated in front of you

You never forced me to do anything I never wanted to do.

I'm not a sadist.

I just want to see everyone happy, no one left out.

So I'd like you... to make love in front of me.

I won't do it.

Yes?

This is silly.

Come out of there.

Okay. All right.

You're hurting me!

I'm not violent. I'm... I'm against violence.

I'm not gonna resist. Look.

So shut up. Okay?

Is the prospect of making love to me so hateful?

Now, that wasn't a friendly thing to do.

Shh, shh.

I'm not resisting! I'm not resisting!

Oh, how sweet of you.

Oh, wake up. Oh.

What about yesterday?

What?

Stay inside.

My love.

My first love.

My great love.

My great lover.

My Valentino.

You know, I thought you had many lovers.

Where are you going?


Kitchen. I have to get something to eat.


Thanks, that's sweet.

Call me.

Okay, with pleasure.

See you.

That's scary to me.

That gives me the creeps.

Listen.

Come and join us.

No, thank you, my sweet.

Thanks a lot.

I love you.

You know that?                   

I love you too.

You love me too?

That's funny.

Are you listening?

It's forever, right?

What's forever?

The two of us.


We'll talk about it in the morning.

I promise.

Oh!

Leave me be!

Listen to me for a second, okay?
